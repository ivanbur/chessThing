# chessThing
--------------------

# What is it?
This is a work-in-progress. It will be an asynchronous chess game, where you make a move and then wait a few days for the other person to respond. It'll store the boardstate of each match using MongoDB, and you will be able to start a game against people that you know (it'll ask you to enter their name and id, e.g. coolusername#1234)

# Stuff to implement
Some stuff that I'm planning to implement are:

  -> accounts
  
  -> starting a game against a random person instead of just people that you know
  
  -> storing boardstates via MongoDB
  
  -> a "start new game" button
  
  -> a homepage where you can look at messages that consist of:
  
    -> telling you that someone made a move
    -> a game invite
    
  -> maybe a "my profile" page
    
    -> could be a little button in the top right with your profile picture
    -> would be on the homepage
  
  -> a list of all games being played
    
    -> would be on the homepage
    -> the main thing to look at on your homepage
    
  -> maybe eventually a friends list so that you don't have to remember an id
